# Docker Networks

Docker provides several types of networks to connect containers and manage their communication. Each type has its specific use case based on isolation, scalability, and network access.

## Types of Docker Networks

### 1. Bridge Network
- **Definition**: The default network type when no specific network is mentioned during container creation.
- **Use case**: Containers on the same bridge network can communicate with each other but are isolated from external networks.
- **Usage**: Suitable for standalone applications or when containers need to communicate with each other but not with external systems.

### 2. Host Network
- **Definition**: The container shares the host’s network stack, meaning it doesn’t have its own IP address but uses the host’s IP.
- **Use case**: Useful when performance is critical, and the container needs full access to the host’s network, bypassing the Docker network layer.
- **Limitation**: No network isolation between the container and the host.

### 3. None Network
- **Definition**: The container is not connected to any network, having no network interfaces.
- **Use case**: Suitable when network access is not required or for fully isolated containers.
- **Limitation**: The container cannot communicate with any other container or external network.

### 4. Overlay Network
- **Definition**: A network that spans across multiple Docker hosts, allowing containers on different hosts to communicate securely.
- **Use case**: Used in Docker Swarm or distributed environments to scale applications across multiple nodes.
- **Benefit**: Provides secure communication between containers across different physical machines.

### 5. Macvlan Network
- **Definition**: Allows assigning a MAC address to each container, making the container appear as a physical device on the network.
- **Use case**: Ideal when containers need to be directly exposed to the physical network, with their own IP addresses.
- **Limitation**: Less isolated compared to bridge networks; used mostly for advanced network configurations.

### 6. Network Plugins
- **Definition**: Third-party network plugins can extend Docker’s networking functionality or integrate it with external network solutions.
- **Use case**: Used for custom networking setups, especially in Kubernetes environments using plugins like CNI.
